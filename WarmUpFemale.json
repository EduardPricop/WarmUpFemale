      When putting together a full-body stretching routine, aim to include at least one stretch for each major muscle group in your body.

You may find that certain muscles feel particularly stiff and need extra attention. For example, people who sit a lot often have tight muscles in their neck, hips, legs, and upper back.

To target particularly stiff areas, you can:

perform multiple stretches for that muscle group
hold the stretch longer
perform the stretch more than once. 
      How to do this stretch:

Stand with your hands against the back of a chair or on a wall.
Stagger your feet, one in front of the other. Keep your back leg straight, your front knee slightly bent, and both feet flat on the ground.
Keeping your back knee straight and back your foot flat on the ground, bend your front knee to lean toward the chair or wall. Do this until you feel a gentle stretch in the calf of your back leg.
Hold the stretch for about 30 seconds.
Repeat on the other side.",
