      When putting together a full-body stretching routine, aim to include at least one stretch for each major muscle group in your body.

You may find that certain muscles feel particularly stiff and need extra attention. For example, people who sit a lot often have tight muscles in their neck, hips, legs, and upper back.

To target particularly stiff areas, you can:

perform multiple stretches for that muscle group
hold the stretch longer
perform the stretch more than once",
